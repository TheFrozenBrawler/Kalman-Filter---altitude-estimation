* **model.py** - file with only model equations of rocket

## Engineering Thesis descripion
The main goal of the thesis is to create an algorithm to detect a rocket apogee with barometric measurements. To achieve this goal, an altitude must be estimated with use of fine-tuned Kalman Filter. This thesis part of project of PUT Rocketlab Student Group. The algorithm will be used during the Spaceport America Cup - an amateur rocketry competition.

## Kalman Filter description
The Kalman filter is based on the model mk. 2 from my private notes.
The model is based on the differential equation of an object, where the state vector consists of position and velocity. The input to the model is simulated acceleration with noise. The measurements are values of simulated altitude with noise.
The filter and model was developed with help of the guidebook "Kalman Filter From The Ground-Up".

## Measurements
Measurements in "Hexa4+_tp02-alt-acc.csv" file were generated by model in Open Rocket software.

## Model
The model has been derived from the state space representation of dynamic object moving in one dimension - estimation of rocket heigth.

With given matrices A, B, C, D the differential equation can be solved and written as:

## TO DO:
- Improve the Q, P and R matrices 
- Think about EKF or UKF
- add apogee detection system based on counting the number of estimated velocity samples equal or less than zero in apogee
- add P matrix reset to get rid of artifact in the filter
- implement the filter in C
- test with 2023 flight data
- handling N/A data, especially in the apogee region
